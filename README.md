# Scrabble Game With GUI!
Play scrabble by yourself with the power of java.

This is my first large JavaFX project and it was a learning process to adapt to the style of JavaFX and its quirks.

If you want to run it, go to application and run Main.java. There is also a jar available on my github that includes a .bat file to run the application. (https://github.com/ALearningCurve/Java-Scrabble-Jar)
